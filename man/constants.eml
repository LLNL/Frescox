The constants from TWOFNR are:

FMSCAL = 0.0481967     ETACNS = 0.15805086

Your old values were

FMSCAL = 0.0478196     ETACNS = 0.157454

and your new values

FMSCAL = 0.048196      ETACNS = 0.157454 (ie unchanged)


The fusion cross section is particularly sensitive:

eg 16O+144Sm at 76 MeV

old FMSCAL   sigF = 349 mb
new FMSCAL   sigF = 336 mb

I guess the effect is large still at sub barrier 
energies (the values are not very sensitive to ETACNS)

Looking at other codes

Hioptim    FMSCAL = 0.04783258    ETACNS = 0.157454
Daizy               0.047834               0.15758

Chuck has hbarc= 197.3289  mu = 931.502
        which gives                FMSCAL = 0.0478445

CCFUS has hbarc= 197.3286  mu = 931.5016
        which gives                FMSCAL = 0.0478447
