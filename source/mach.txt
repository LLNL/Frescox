*  MACH =
*  1) standard serial F90
*  2) standard serial F90 with BLAS
*  3) MPI on SGI Altix ( at MSU ) which could only read in from the master thread so had to pass all input variables to the other threads
*  4) MPI on all other architectures
*               (note 3 and 4 both use BLAS too)
*  STDINALL if all threads can read from stdin
