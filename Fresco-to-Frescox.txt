Changes from Fresco to Frescox

1. More RELA options for relativistic kinematics

3. NUMNODE for MPI operation and NTHREAD for OPENMP
   CCREAL: all potentials and couplings are real-valued, to speed CC solutions
   ELPMAX = energy ELAB below which the LPMAX in each partition are applied 

5. BTYPE for type of R-matrix boundary condition (including 'A' for Brune basis)
   BNDX replaces EBETA for value in boundary condition

7. Core-excitation options for XCDCC calculations, with more details in CDCC outputs in fort.57

8. TCFILE to generate transmission coefficients in fort.5420

9. Options PRMAX and LPRMAX1 to vary Rmax and Lmax in each partition separately
 
10. More SHAPEs for couplings:
    14  SHAPE  Projectile second-order coupled by matrix elements read in.
    15  SHAPE  Target second-order coupled by matrix elements read in.
    16  SHAPE  Target & projectile simultaneous second-order coupled by matrix elements read in.
    17         Target & projectile all-order coupled by matrix elements read in.
    20  NUM  Super-soft N-N potl. of de Tourreil & Sprung (SSC(C))
    21  NUM  User-supplied N-N potential via subroutine NNPOT.

12. NLAG for bound states: Use Lagrange mesh to find bound states with NLAG basis functions with code PLUTO

13. PHASE for bin states: Find potential to give phase shift of PHASE degrees at energy -BE for bins. Requires NLAG>0.

Searching:

1. DAMP for Reich-Moore imaginary energy for damping
   KIND=7 parameters for searching on this value

2. RWA to indicate RWA for R-matrix widths, not formal widths
   B for specific boundary condition number

3. KIND=6 for searching on data energy shifts DATAESHIFT

4. LEG for searching on Legendre coefficients of angular distributions

5. Aflip for changing angle to 180-angle

7. More searching commands:

  V: query status of unfixed search variables
  CHA: query status of changed search variables
  CHI: list chi^2 status by dataset
  FXWID : fix all R-matrix widths variables.
  FXRPE : fix all R-matrix pole energy variables.
  FXPBG : fix all pole energies variables with 'BG' in their name.
  FXBG : fix all variables with 'BG' in their name.
  FXNOR : fix all dataset norm variables (kind=5)
  FXSHF : fix all dataset energy shift variables (kind=6)
  FREE : free all R-matrix energies and widths variables. 
  ELIM {\tt emin emax}: restrict data scans to this energy range for plots and chi^2 sums
  POLES {\tt emin emax}: vary only R-matrix poles in this energy range (others are fixed)

Only Fresco has the stabilization method for coupled-channels solutions.
Only Fresco has the RSALPHA exponential damping factor for overlap wave functions
